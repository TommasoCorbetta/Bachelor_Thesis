# Bachelor-thesis
My bachelor thesis about "Coupling Between Black Hole and Cosmological Solutions to Einstein's Equations" in physics. This thesis aims to investigate the McVittie (1933) computations and physical implications, and to discuss the new conclusions about the origin of D.E. made by Farrah et al. (2023).
